1. jobs running on Kuberntes containers (having GPU) may need much more time to finish.
eg. python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --device=gpu --model="+JOB_NAME+" --batch_size=16 --num_batches=100 --num_gpus=1
 (set cpu = 1, gpu = 1)

without counting overheads:
- physical machine takes: (need to test this claim)
- Kuberntes nodes takes 2 seconds

* gpu container needs to have at least 1 cpu otherwise gpu job will be too slow.

2. overheads running the jobs:
- Tensorflow may be 90 secs
    question: does TF-gpu takes more time to setup than TF-cpu
- creating containers: few seconds to 15 seconds
